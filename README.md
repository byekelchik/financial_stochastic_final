In this investigation, we construct HRP portfolios using the yFinance datafeed using the below securities:

- VCR: Consumer Discretionary
- VXUS: Total International ETF
- VDE: Energy

- VHT: Health Care
- VIS: Industrials
- VNQ: Real Estate
- VPU: Utilities
- VGIT: Intermediate US Treasury
- VGLT: Long-term US Treasury
- VGSH: Short-term US Treasury

We analyize HRP's performance constructed using various distance metrics vs. the benchmark mean-variance portfolio
